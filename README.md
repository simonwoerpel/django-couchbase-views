# django-couchbase-views
django-like querying and viewing of couchbase documents

this is a simple starting point, just a few snippets to an approach to query couchbase buckets in the same behaviour as standard django orm views.

this project is not intended to be a full couchbase wrapper. the idea is to use couchbases' map/reduce views in/as django class based views.
